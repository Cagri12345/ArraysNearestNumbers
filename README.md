# Nearest Numbers in an Array

This Java program finds the nearest smaller and larger numbers to a user-provided input within a predefined array. 

## Program Description

The program does the following:

1. **Takes an array of integers** and a user-provided number as input.
2. **Finds the nearest smaller number** to the user's input.
3. **Finds the nearest larger number** to the user's input.
4. **Outputs the results** to the console.

## How It Works

1. The program first initializes an array with the values `{15, 12, 788, 1, -1, -778, 2, 0}`.
2. The user is prompted to enter a number.
3. The program then iterates through the array:
    - It compares each element with the user's input.
    - If the element is smaller than the input, it checks if it's the nearest smaller number.
    - If the element is larger than the input, it checks if it's the nearest larger number.
4. Finally, the program prints out the nearest smaller and larger numbers.
